        Maximum number of times request will be retried. RetryFirst tag means
        first response that will reply on the request will be used. RetryLast
        means that if response is timed out it will not be used, even if it will
        be answered before the second attempt is answered. Technically latter
        works by changing request id when the response is timed out.

                not scalable to multiple boxes (zerogw instances).
                You have been warned.
